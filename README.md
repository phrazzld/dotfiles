# workbench

Public, version-controlled workstation configuration with explicit shared,
Mirrodin, and Serenity layers.

## Profiles

- `config/shared/`: public-safe shell modules and cross-host application assets.
- `config/hosts/serenity/`: the lightweight macOS daily-driver profile.
- `config/hosts/mirrodin/`: the Linux engineering-workstation profile.
- `~/.config/workbench/env.local.private.zsh`: optional untracked secrets and
  machine-local overrides. It is never stored here.

Each host manifest is the source of truth for installed paths. Preview first:

```bash
./install.sh --profile serenity
./install.sh --profile serenity --apply --adopt
```

Applying creates an immutable release under `~/.local/share/workbench/releases`
and backs up adopted files under `~/.local/state/workbench/backups`. It never
links live configuration directly into the mutable checkout.

Source edits do not authorize applying profiles, granting privileges, activating
timers, or administering a host. Those operations require explicit task scope.

## Agent message board

The private Daybook board at `daybook/meta/agents-board/` can supply operational
context or handoffs when an authorized task needs it. It is not a prerequisite
for public source work. Keep private board contents out of this repository;
refer to secret stores by name, never by value.

## Secret scanning

TruffleHog is the standard scanner. The repository hooks check staged content
and outgoing commits, fail closed when scanning fails, and suppress raw values.
To safely layer these checks in front of existing hooks across local repositories:

```bash
scripts/manage-trufflehog-hooks --root ~/Development
scripts/manage-trufflehog-hooks --root ~/Development --apply
```

The manager records each repository's prior `core.hooksPath`, chains its existing
hooks, deduplicates linked worktrees, and supports `--uninstall`. Do not set a
global `core.hooksPath`; that silently bypasses repository-owned hook systems.

## Quality gate

```bash
scripts/check.sh
```

This validates shell syntax, ShellCheck error-level findings, profile manifests,
and the full Git history with TruffleHog.

## Appearance

Serenity uses a calm, highly legible Flexoki light/dark Ghostty pairing and a
cool-blue prompt. Mirrodin uses Ember/Ember Dawn and a warmer copper prompt, so
remote context is visible without loud banners. `bin/sync-system-theme` handles
the broader appearance synchronization where installed.

## Emergency recovery (Mirrodin)

Linux recovery is separate from the HOME-relative profile installer:

```bash
scripts/setup-recovery.sh          # Read-only plan; no sudo or writes
scripts/setup-recovery.sh --apply  # Explicit apply; sudo when needed
```

This manages only `kernel.sysrq=176`, sourced from
`config/hosts/mirrodin/sysctl.d/60-workbench-recovery.conf`, installed as
root:root mode 0644 at `/etc/sysctl.d/60-workbench-recovery.conf`, and activated
without reloading unrelated sysctl files. Reapplying is idempotent. Existing
target content must match exactly; symlinks and different content are refused.
There is no automatic adoption: review and back up/move conflicting content
aside yourself before applying. Other sysctl files remain untouched; review
any later `kernel.sysrq` override separately before relying on boot persistence.

Use **S/U/B**: hold Alt+SysRq (often PrintScreen), press **S** (sync), wait for
completion, then **U** (remount read-only), wait for completion, then **B**
(reboot). Mask 176 enables sync, remount, and reboot/poweroff, not full REISUB.
This is not guaranteed GPU recovery: the kernel and keyboard must still respond.
**Emergency reboot loses unsaved work and permits physical-access denial of
service, even while locked.** The installer never reboots, changes locking,
or adds a listener, watchdog, or unlock bypass.

## Unattended administration (Mirrodin)

The operator approved full passwordless sudo for `phaedrus` on Mirrodin.
This is an account-wide grant: every process under that account can obtain
root, not only agents. Agents still run as the normal user and elevate
individual commands. No SSH login rule, desktop lock rule, or polkit default
is changed.

```bash
scripts/setup-privileges.sh          # Validate source and show plan; no writes
scripts/setup-privileges.sh --apply  # Install with sudo, or run as root
```

The source is `config/hosts/mirrodin/sudoers.d/zz-workbench-phaedrus`.
The installer validates the source and existing policy, then creates
`/etc/sudoers.d/zz-workbench-phaedrus` atomically as a root:root `0440` copy.
It validates the combined policy and removes its new grant on validation
failure. Matching installs are unchanged; conflicting files, symlinks, and
incorrect metadata are refused. The grant names both `phaedrus` and `mirrodin`;
the installer also refuses another host. Normal profile installation does
not grant root.

Before the first grant, an agent without an operator-accessible terminal can
request desktop approval from this checkout:

```bash
pkexec /usr/bin/bash "$PWD/scripts/setup-privileges.sh" --apply
```

After installation, verify without using or updating cached credentials:

```bash
/usr/bin/sudo -n -k /usr/bin/id -u  # Must print 0 with no prompt
```

SSH and background jobs can then use `sudo -n` for authorized operations.
They do not need a local desktop approval. Connectivity, job survival after
disconnect, and browser/native desktop control remain separate capabilities.

To remove only this grant and validate the remaining policy from an authorized
terminal, then clear the account's cached sudo credentials:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/bash -c 'rm -- /etc/sudoers.d/zz-workbench-phaedrus && visudo -c'
sudo -K
```

This restores the remaining host policy, including password-required general
administration and the existing narrow passwordless commands.

## Meeting transcription (Mirrodin)

Local meeting recording, transcription, and speaker diarization via `meet` (available on `PATH` via `bin/` or `~/.local/bin/meet`):

```bash
# First-time setup: installs whisper and diarization stack into ~/.local/share/meet-venv
meet setup

# Record a call, transcribe, diarize, and write note to ~/Documents/daybook/meetings/
meet session

# Transcribe and diarize an existing audio file
meet all <audio-file>

# Watch folder for incoming audio files to auto-transcribe
meet watch [inbox-directory]
```

Capture requires Linux PulseAudio/PipeWire (`pactl`) and ffmpeg. GPU acceleration uses CUDA when available.
